# Huffman-Coding

- Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.

## How to run
- run the .py programing using the huffman.txt. From here the code is going to preform the huffman encoding. Then will use the helper to prodeced a encoded file based on the huffman codes. Then use the decoded helper to decode the the encoded file. If the code is correct the oupt in the decoded file should match the input file. You can use any diff program to check this.
